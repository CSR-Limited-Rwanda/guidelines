# Development Guidelines for Live Projects

## Introduction  
This document outlines mandatory guidelines for all team members working on live projects. Following these guidelines ensures code quality, maintains security, and prevents potential production issues. Adherence to these standards is crucial for delivering a seamless user experience and maintaining the integrity of our systems.

---

## UI/UX Guidelines  

### Design Consistency  
- Follow the established design system and patterns.  
- Maintain consistent spacing, alignment, and component styles.  
- Use approved color schemes and typography.  
- Ensure compliance with accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1).  
- Document new UI patterns or components introduced.  

### User Experience  
- Design with a mobile-first approach in mind.  
- Account for loading states, transitions, and feedback mechanisms.  
- Implement proper error states for user clarity.  
- Ensure responsive design across all screen sizes and devices.  
- Validate user flows through prototyping and testing before implementation.

## Frontend Guidelines  

### Code Quality  
- Write clear and descriptive component names.  
- Break components into small, focused, reusable units.  
- Remove unnecessary `console.log` statements and debugging tools.  
- Follow existing code patterns and maintain a consistent code style.  
- Use proper TypeScript types or PropTypes for props validation.  

### Performance  
- Optimize images before committing to the codebase.  
- Implement code splitting and lazy loading where applicable.  
- Monitor and minimize bundle sizes to ensure fast load times.  
- Use proper caching strategies for assets and API responses.  
- Optimize rendering performance by reducing unnecessary re-renders.  

### Testing  
- Write unit tests for all components.  
- Test responsive breakpoints and device compatibility.  
- Verify cross-browser compatibility.  
- Test error states, edge cases, and loading scenarios.  
- Check accessibility compliance using tools like Lighthouse or Axe.

## Backend Guidelines  

### Data Security  
- Never commit sensitive information like API keys, secrets, or credentials.  
- Use environment variables to store sensitive data.  
- Validate all incoming data rigorously.  
- Secure API endpoints with proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.  
- Follow industry best practices for securing data at rest and in transit.  

### Database  
- Write safe, reversible database migrations.  
- Back up data before running any migrations.  
- Implement proper indexing to optimize query performance.  
- Handle data relationships carefully to maintain data integrity.  
- Document all schema changes clearly.  

### Testing Requirements  
- Write comprehensive unit tests for all backend services.  
- Test edge cases in business logic.  
- Mock external dependencies in tests to isolate functionality.  
- Write integration tests for critical API flows.  
- Test database queries, migrations, and schema changes.  
- Cover error handling and exceptions extensively.  
- Test with various user roles and permissions.  
- Validate API response formats and status codes.  
- Test pagination, filtering, and sorting mechanisms.  

### API Design  
- Follow REST or GraphQL conventions consistently.  
- Implement meaningful error messages and proper status codes.  
- Document all API endpoints with clear usage instructions.  
- Version APIs to ensure backward compatibility.  
- Use rate limiting to prevent abuse of APIs.

## API URL Structure  

When accessing resource-level API endpoints, use `resource-id` or `resource-slug`.  

### Base Structure:  
`{app-name}/{feature}/{resource}/{resource-id}/{action}`  

### Examples:  

1. **Collection-level Endpoint**:  
   - **URL:** `app-name/feature/items/`  
   - **Purpose:** List or create items.  
   - **Methods:**  
     - `GET` — List all items.  
     - `POST` — Create a new item.  

2. **Single Resource Endpoint**:  
   - **URL:** `app-name/feature/items/{item-id}/`  
   - **Purpose:** Retrieve or delete an item by ID.  
   - **Methods:**  
     - `GET` — Retrieve the item.  
     - `DELETE` — Delete the item.  

3. **Update Endpoint**:  
   - **URL:** `app-name/feature/items/{item-id}/update/`  
   - **Purpose:** Update an item.  
   - **Methods:**  
     - `PUT` — Replace the entire resource.  
     - `PATCH` — Partially update the resource.  

4. **Filtered or Nested Resources**:  
   - **URL:** `app-name/feature/items/category/{category-id}/`  
   - **URL:** `app-name/feature/items/status/{status}/`  
   - **Purpose:** Retrieve items filtered by category or status.  
   - **Methods:**  
     - `GET` — Retrieve filtered data.  

5. **Bulk Actions**:  
   - **URL:** `app-name/feature/items/bulk-delete/`  
   - **Purpose:** Perform bulk operations.  
   - **Methods:**  
     - `POST` — Perform bulk actions (e.g., delete multiple items).  

6. **Search and Query Parameters**:  
   - **URL:** `app-name/feature/items/?search=term&filter=value`  
   - **Purpose:** Search and filter items.  
   - **Methods:**  
     - `GET` — Retrieve filtered data.

## Common Guidelines  

### Pull Request Process  
- Run all tests locally before submitting.  
- Focus on keeping PRs small and focused.  
- Write clear and concise PR descriptions.  
- Include relevant screenshots or test outputs.  
- Respond to code reviews within 24 hours.  

### Version Control  
- Write clear, descriptive commit messages.  
- Regularly sync branches with the main branch.  
- Avoid committing unnecessary files (e.g., `node_modules`).  
- Use feature branches for development.  
- Follow the defined branching strategy.  

### Documentation  
- Keep the README updated.  
- Document all environment variables and dependencies.  
- Update API documentation with every change.  
- Record breaking changes and migration steps.  
- Ensure documentation is up to date and clear.

## Consequences of Not Following Guidelines  

Failure to follow these guidelines can cause serious issues, such as:  
- **UI/UX violations** leading to inconsistent user experience or accessibility problems.  
- **Frontend violations** causing performance issues and a poor user experience.  
- **Backend violations** resulting in data loss, security vulnerabilities, or downtime.  

These guidelines are in place to ensure high-quality deliverables. Please review them daily until they are second nature.
